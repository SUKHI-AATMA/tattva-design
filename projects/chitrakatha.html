The brand wants to broaden the visitor’s perspective by celebrating the culture of its common people. With the age-old local folk legends and stories that illuminate their experiences and values. For the explorer and tourist alike, these stories present a very unique and real experience of the beautiful desert state like no other. Stories that reveal not only local tradition and culture, but their rich emotional texture and rustic wisdom that can engage the mind and warm the heart.</p><p>Chitrakatha is all about Rajasthan never experienced before, with its amazing, unforgettable, earthy flavours of life.</p></div></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><h3>THE PERSONALITY</h3><p>Chitrakatha chooses unusually wise and entertaining gems from Rajasthani literature, folklore, history and tradition for its visitors. It presents the memory, emotion and wisdom of an entire race of people in an immersive and engaging experiential space. Chitrakatha is a cultural offering, a place of feeling and meaning, a heartfelt ode to Rajasthan.</p><h3>THE OFFERING</h3><p>CK is an open platform that shines a light on the indigenous beauty of Rajasthan. It is a proud curator of Rajasthani art, literature and culture, with a contemporary storytelling flair.</p></div></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_05.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><p>Through times immemorial, storytelling has been an integral part of Rajasthani culture. Its rich colloquial wisdom is filled with insights into human nature and emotions, and ranges over culture, history, faith and lessons of life. This wisdom has been passed down the generations through renowned mediums as paintings, stone carvings, dance, theatre, folk songs, literature, and especially folk tales that ring with great potency.</p><h3>THE EXPERIENCED HAND</h3><p>We say, “With age comes wisdom.” Experience is the journey to knowledge, for a life lived well. The hands of an old man have a thousand experiences to narrate. That hand of experience welcomes people, inviting them into his world of tales and wisdom, to Chitrakatha.</p></div></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><p><strong>The old hand:</strong> The wrinkles of an old hand symbolize age and experience. With time, an old hand gains wisdom by experiencing life as it is. It has much knowledge to share in the form of stories, which are but echoes from the past. </br><strong>Offering a flower:</strong> The gesture of offering a flower connotes compassion and love. In India, guests are often welcomed with flowers, a mark of humility and respect. </br><strong>Flower petals/ bunch of flowers:</strong> represent various cultures, identities and ideas coming together. </br>To offer a flower is to welcome, and to show goodwill. A wrinkled, old hand shows age, experience and wisdom. </br>
A wrinkled, old hand offering a multi-aspect flower is a visual confluence of these ideas, that says “Knowledge is inviting you”. </br>
This is a place where visitors encounter the timeless soul of Rajasthan. And this old hand has a thousand stories to narrate!

With exemplary style, Vijaydan Detha chose traditional stories from the rich folklore, and recrafted them with gripping and enchanting narration. By his brilliant pen, fantasy, legend and myth blend with introspection and worldviews like no other, making him a fantasist-realist storyteller without par. Though filled with kings and queens, farmers and soldiers, merchants and mendicants, masters and disciplines, the power and wisdom in his writing turned their stories into a compassionate critique of modern life. Detha was admired for his insight into human nature, and for dealing with universal themes.</p></div></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_19.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><h3>New Life.</h3><p>New Life (Dohri Joon), one of the more radical works of Vijaydan Detha, is about two young girls, who are victims of mismatched marriages. The story has them boldly submitting to their personal truth, and opting to spend life together in a same sex relationship. Amidst social derision and outraged fathers, they find unlikely support from a righteous ghost, and go on to live in a happy, emotionally fulfilling bond in the lap of nature. Nothing short of rebellion against patriarchy, the story challenges outmoded notions of gender inequality and social customs.</p></div></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_21.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_22.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_23.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_24.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_25.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><h3>The Crafty Thief.</h3><p>Here is a thief, deemed a peril to civil society, yet a man of principles. As a jest, he takes five vows: never to eat in a gold plate, never to lead a procession in his honour, never to become a king, never to marry a princess and never to lie. He stands by his vows in spite of events that test his resolve. His peculiar steadfastness gains him undreamt of luxuries. A brilliant satire, the story portrays the paradox of living with integrity in a society that punishes honesty. The line between the righteous and the dishonest is blurred, depicting the subversive negotiation between truth and falsehood.</p></div></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_27.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_28.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_29.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_30.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><h3>Chouboli.</h3><p>The story begins with a rich thakur (provincial leader) who take pride that he can shoot a hundred and eight arrows through his wife’s nose-ring every day. One day the hapless wife courageously questions his whim. His second wife too challenges his hollow valour. His aim is to wed Princess Chouboli, whose hand no man has ever won. An intricate narrative of story within story follows, which ultimately questions man’s chivalry and woman’s true potential. Ultimately, this captivating read resolves who wins the princess, while raising a powerful debate between the sexes about the true nature of courage and intelligence.</p></div></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_32.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_33.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style='color:#000;background:#73bb95;'><div class="content"><h3>The Limit.</h3><p>Once lived a rich and prosperous merchant, whose wealth eclipsed the king’s treasure. Though charitable, he was deplorably vain. However, he had a virtuous wife, who was so devoted to sacred books that she detested the trappings of wealth. The merchant yearns for the ultimate wealth, and his wife highly prizes wisdom from books. With native acumen, the story tells of how they both eventually realize the futility of their desires, while recognizing the nature’s wisdom that is more precious than wealth and knowledge.</p></div></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_35.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_36.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_37.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_38.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_39.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><img src="/images/work/ChitraKatha/ChitraKatha_40.jpg" alt=""></li><li class='col' style=''><a class="nextProject" href="/projects/kalon"  data-rowIndex="1"><div class="content nextproject">
